1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm still up to lead dance, rising up through the air

2
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I pay head in the distance, so is she more in light

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I hit the heavy on my side, you're dead

4
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I had to stop for the night, then she stood in the doorway

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Her division bell, then I was thinking to myself

6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
This could be heaven, this could be hell

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Didn't you lift up back and up?

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
And she showed me the way

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Then we'll voices down the corridor

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Thought I heard them say

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Welcome to the hotel California

12
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thought you'd love me, please

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Thought you'd love me, please

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Thought you'd love me, please

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thought you'd love me, please

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Thought you'd love me, please

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Maybe time will come

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
You can find it here

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Her mind is different and twisted

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
She got the Mercedes-Benz ball

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
She got a lot of pretty pretty boys

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
She calls friends

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How they dance in the courtyard

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Sweet summer sweat

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
So dance to remember

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Some dance to forget

27
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
So I'm calling the captain

28
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Please bring me my wine

29
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
We have it in that desperate list

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
In 1960, man

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
And still those voices are calling for fire

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Hey

33
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Make you laugh in the middle of the night

34
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Just till you then say

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Welcome to the hotel California

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Thought you'd love me, please

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Thought you'd love me, please

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Thought you'd love me, please

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Thought you'd love me, please

40
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Thought you'd love me, please

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Thought you'd love me, please

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thought you'd love me, please

43
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Mirrors on this ceiling

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
You can't champion on ice

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
And she said

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We were all just prisoners here

47
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Of our own device

48
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
And in the master's chambers

49
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Gathered for their feast

50
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The stabbit with their stealing eyes

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
But they just can't kill the beast

52
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Last thing I remember

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I was running for the gold

54
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I had to find a passage back

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
To the place I was before

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Relaxed at the nightmare

57
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
We are a problem to receive

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You can check out at it's time you like

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
But you can never leave

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I was running for the gold

61
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I had to find a passage back

62
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
To the place I was before

63
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I was running for the gold

64
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I had to find a passage back

65
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
To the place I was before

66
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I was running for the gold

67
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I had to find a passage back

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
To the place I was before

69
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I was running for the gold

70
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I had to find a passage back

71
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
To the place I was before

72
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I was running for the gold

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I had to find a passage back

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
To the place I was before

75
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I was running for the gold

76
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I had to find a passage back

77
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
To the place I was before

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I was running for the gold

79
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I had to find a passage back

80
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
To the place I was before

81
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I was running for the gold

82
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I had to find a passage back

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
To the place I was before

84
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I was running for the gold

85
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I had to find a passage back

86
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
To the place I was before
